1. Problem Breakdown
Input: PDF of an exam question paper.
Output: Structured questions classified as:
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ): Question + options.
Numerical Questions: Question + expected input format.
Steps:

Extract text and layout from the PDF.
Parse the extracted text to identify and structure questions.
Classify questions into categories.
Format the output for an online test system.
2. Data Requirements
To train your model, you'll need labeled datasets containing examples of question papers in both raw (PDF/text) and structured formats. These datasets should cover:

MCQs (with and without options)
Numerical questions
True/False questions
Paragraph-based questions (if applicable)
Sources for Training Data
Publicly Available Exam Papers:

Use question papers from educational boards (e.g., CBSE, SAT, GRE).
Websites hosting free past papers or sample tests.
Generated Data:

Create a synthetic dataset by manually preparing PDF files with diverse question formats and corresponding structured data (JSON/CSV).
Online Question Banks:

Scrape or use APIs from websites like Examveda, LeetCode, or Khan Academy (with permission).
Datasets:

Public datasets like RACE (reading comprehension) may have structured question formats that can be used for text classification and parsing.
3. Data Annotation
Manually annotate extracted text with labels:

Question Type: MCQ, Numerical, True/False.
Question Segments:
Question Body.
Options (if MCQ).
Correct Answer/Range (optional, for training validation).
Example JSON for Labeled Data:
json
Copy code
{
  "question_id": "Q1",
  "question_type": "MCQ",
  "question_text": "What is the capital of France?",
  "options": [
    {"A": "Paris"},
    {"B": "Berlin"},
    {"C": "Madrid"},
    {"D": "Rome"}
  ],
  "correct_answer": "A"
}
4. Preprocessing Pipeline
PDF to Text Conversion: Use tools like pdfminer, PyPDF2, or Tesseract OCR (for scanned PDFs).

Text Cleanup:

Remove headers, footers, and noise.
Use regex to identify common patterns in questions (e.g., numbered questions, "A.", "B.", etc.).
Segmentation:

Split text into individual questions and detect options.
Annotation Augmentation:

Add bounding box annotations if leveraging layout-aware models like LayoutLM.
5. Model Selection
Text Classification:

Use models like BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT to classify question types.
Fine-tune with labeled data.
Sequence Parsing:

Use sequence-to-sequence models (e.g., T5, GPT) for question parsing.
Layout-Aware Models:

If layout information (e.g., table structures, position of options) is crucial, consider models like LayoutLMv3.
6. Testing Data
Use a separate set of unseen exam papers for testing. This should:

Be diverse in structure (e.g., different fonts, formats, and layouts).
Include edge cases (e.g., no options for MCQ, mixed formats).
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: Correct classification of question types.
Precision/Recall: For identifying options, numerical ranges, etc.
Human Review: Compare automated output with manually structured results.
7. Tools & Frameworks
Text Extraction:

pdfminer.six
PyPDF2
Tesseract OCR (for images).
NLP Models:

Hugging Face Transformers.
SpaCy for text preprocessing.
Annotation Tools:

Label Studio.
Custom scripts for manual tagging.
Data Storage:

JSON/CSV for structured outputs.
SQL/NoSQL databases for integration with an online system.
8. Example Workflow
Extract text:
python
Copy code
from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text
text = extract_text("example.pdf")
Parse text to identify questions and options using regex or rule-based methods.
Feed parsed questions into a classification model (e.g., fine-tuned BERT).
Output structured JSON for ingestion by the online test system.
